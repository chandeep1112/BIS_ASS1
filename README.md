# TASK
We are predicting the parameters Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10 from a 10-year dataset from an IoT sensor on the road.

# Models used

We have used

1.Bayesian Ridge
2.Kernal Ridge
3.Gradient Boosting

# Results
The RMSE value of models are:-

Bayesian Ridge --> 75.04493535347912
Kernal Ridge --> 110.819843444973701
Gradient Boosting --> 40.2042701133272


# Best model is Gradient Boosting with RMSE 40.2042701133272
